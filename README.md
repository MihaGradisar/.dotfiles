# My dotfiles

## Instalation
Clone the repo and move into the root directory.
Use stow on specific directories to place the config files in the correct locations on your machine.

Example:

```sh
stow nvim
```

This will create a symlink in ~/.config/nvim.

### Dependencies
- stow
- fzf
- zoxide
- lazygit

Dotfiles are a work in progress.
A more comprehensive README and install script will be added when I have time.
